# vim-extras
Hello! This repo acts as my ~/.vim file. Thus the .example_vimrc isn't the real deal. I'll keep it updated though!

## Future Projects
I am also working on creating a vim plugin that will enhance note taking
The first step is to create a basic syntax highlighter. Extra features will be added in due time.

### Current Status
I recently just created the ntmd syntax. It is located in the syntax folder. I do not have the autodect working quite yet, so to activate this syntax, you need to enter the following in vim: 
`set syntax=ntmd`
